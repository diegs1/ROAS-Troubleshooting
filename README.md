Overview

This lab from the Cisco SRWE NetAcad course (provided by our instructor) focuses on fixing inter-VLAN routing issues using Router-on-a-Stick. I realized from this activity that troubleshooting existing networks is much harder than designing one from scratch due to hidden misconfigurations. I have gained practical experience diagnosing inter-VLAN routing problems and confirming fixes. I found doing this lab very very fun :)

Key Concepts

- Trunking & Allowed VLANs: Ensure trunks carry required VLANs and native VLANs match.
- Router-on-a-Stick (ROAS): Correct subinterface setup for inter-VLAN routing.
- VLAN Configuration: Proper VLAN creation and port assignment.
- Troubleshooting Workflow: Check switches, routers, and PCs to isolate issues.

What I Learned

- Trunks and native VLANs can break connectivity even if cables are fine.
- Fixing someone else’s mistakes is way harder than building a network from scratch.
- Troubleshooting is mostly checking configs step by step, not just looking at the diagram
