Overview

This lab from the Cisco SRWE NetAcad course (provided by our instructor) focuses on fixing inter-VLAN routing issues using Router-on-a-Stick. I realized that troubleshooting existing networks is much harder than designing one from scratch due to hidden misconfigurations and logical errors.

Key Concepts

Trunking & Allowed VLANs: Ensure trunks carry required VLANs and native VLANs match.

Router-on-a-Stick (ROAS): Correct subinterface setup for inter-VLAN routing.

VLAN Configuration: Proper VLAN creation and port assignment.

Troubleshooting Workflow: Check switches, routers, and PCs to isolate issues.

What I Learned

Misconfigured trunks and native VLAN mismatches can block traffic.

Correct router subinterface configuration is crucial for ROAS.

Systematic troubleshooting is needed for logical and physical network issues.

Verification of each device’s configuration is essential.

Gained practical experience diagnosing inter-VLAN routing problems and confirming fixes.
